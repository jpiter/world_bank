# Classification Problem on Prediction Defaults for World Bank Projects.

### Data Collection.

In the first attempt to collect data, I obtained:

1. Data on WB projects, contracts, and loans to subsidize projects.
2. List of debarred companies and individuals by WB(current and historical).

It turns out there is no straitford way to reconnect debarred names to projects, as for many of them there was no historical data left in contract database about suppliers participation.

In the second attempt, I downloaded and analyzed Notices of Uncontested Sanctions proceedings, linking together the name of debarred company to a loan, and then to a project.
